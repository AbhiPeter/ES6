1)what is block scoping?

- block level scoping cane be done with ES6 as previous there was no block level scope.

-block level scoping can be achived by using let keyword.

-block level scope will be accesible within block only

{
    let a=37

    here a will be accesible within block only
}

//here a cannot be accesed.

-using var keyword it was function scope so the variable was accesible outside the block.

        {
            var a=30;
        }

        //here a is accesible as this is function scope 

-variable declared with let inside the block are only accesible inside that scope.

-also you can acshive same by using const as const and let are same in scoping but we cannot change the value of constant references
