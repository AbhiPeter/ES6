1)what is differnce between let and Var?

-let and var are used for function decalration or variable decalrtion.
-var is function scope while let is block scoped.
-variable decalred with var is defined throughout the prorgam as compared to let.
-Hoisting is not applied for let where hoisting can be done for var.
    console.log(x);
    var x=3;

    here variable hoisiting is applied for the var decalration on other hand, let does not support variable hoisiting
    
-let is the block scope where var is fucntion scope which will see in below exmaple:-

let a=20
{
    let a =30;
    //this a willbe scoped in this block only and cannot be accesed outside the block
}
where as:

var a=30;
{
    var a=60;
}

here the output will be 60 as var decalation is function scope.

-variable decalred inside the fucntion have a function scope for both let and var:
    function add()
    {
        var firstName="peter";
    }

    function add()
    {
        let firstName="parker";

    }

-variable decalred with var cannot have the block scope:

{
    var a=20;
}
//here a will be accessable

where as let are block scope :

{
    let a=30;
}

//a cannot be accesed here

-before es6 javascript did not have the block scope varible declared with let keyword can have the block scope

-gloabl scope :-variabel decalred outside the function for both let and var will have the global scope

-redeclaring var is allowed but when with let on same block is not allowed

    var a=20 //allowed
    var a=30//allowed

let a=45 //allowed
let a=34 //not alowed as we are chaning the value on same block scope
